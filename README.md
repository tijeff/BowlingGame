Step realized:

1. Project & Git environment created...
2. All rolls with no pins

* spare case
  * create test for SPARE case
  * go back to add frame concept in code
  * add save of all rolls    
  * refactor to compute score with frame concept
  * re-add spare test
  * try to treat spare
  * revert to previous state to treat frame case
  * compute score frame by frame
  * readd spare test
